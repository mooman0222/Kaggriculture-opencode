# kaggriculture-cppsim

A bit-exact C++ engine for Kaggle's [Kaggriculture](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggriculture) competition at **1.32.7**, with a batch Python API (`kagsim`). Episodes run in well under a millisecond: cheap enough to ask statistical questions properly instead of guessing.

## Credit first

The engine core is **[nikital7's bit-exact C++ port](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nikital7/4000x-environment-speedup-kaggriculture)**, which solved the three genuinely hard problems: CPython's Mersenne Twister exactly (init_by_array seeding, 53-bit doubles, `_randbelow` rejection sampling), Python dict insertion-order semantics where the 100-item shed cap decides which goods die, and slot-index market resolution. This repository is that work, carried forward:

* **patched to engine 1.32.7**: the upstream port targets 1.32.6, which predates the rebalance that gave carrot, tomato and egg a convex `hinge` scarcity branch (and carrot a 5x amplitude). The patch is the `F_HINGE` shape plus three market rows in `sim/sim.hpp`;
* **re-validated the adversarial way**: the pristine 1.32.6 build FAILS every 1.32.7 trace in `traces/` (first divergence: a $4 carrot sale at step 97), the patched build reproduces money and market inventory for both players at every one of 719 steps, on all of them: including heavy episodes banking 85-114k with shed-cap pressure;
* **wrapped for Python** so any tool can plug it in.

## Install

The repo IS the distribution channel, deliberately. No PyPI package, and none planned: this is a competition-scoped tool tied to a moving engine, the competition ends soon, and a registry package would be maintenance with no upside: worse, a stale `pip install kagsim` after a rebalance would hand people a confidently wrong simulator. Installing from the repo means you always build today's code against today's traces, and you read this file on the way in.

```bash
# as a dependency, from anywhere
pip install git+https://github.com/destbreso/kaggriculture-cppsim

# or pinned in a requirements.txt / pyproject dependency list
# kagsim @ git+https://github.com/destbreso/kaggriculture-cppsim@main

# or from a local clone, editable while you hack on it
git clone https://github.com/destbreso/kaggriculture-cppsim
pip install -e kaggriculture-cppsim
```

Needs a C++17 compiler (clang or gcc; on Kaggle's Linux images gcc is present). Kaggle NOTEBOOK kernels run without internet, so a git install will not work there: clone locally, or attach the repo as a Kaggle dataset and `pip install /kaggle/input/<dataset>/`.

```python
import kagsim

# actions: the same per-turn dicts the real environment consumes
stream = kagsim.Stream(actions)            # convert once
idle = kagsim.Stream([])

bank_a, bank_b = kagsim.run_episode(stream, idle, seed=11)

# batch mode, GIL released: characterise a strategy on 2,000 seeds in ~1 s
jobs = [(stream, idle, seed) for seed in range(2000)]
results = kagsim.run_many(jobs)            # ~2,000+ episodes/sec/core
```

`run_many` uses every core by default and returns results identical to the sequential path, because episodes are independent and seeded independently: pass `threads=1` to force sequential, `threads=N` to cap it.

Measured on a Mac mini M4 (24 GB, 10 cores): **4,139 episodes/sec single-threaded and 24,442 with `threads=0`**, against 0.97 episodes/sec for the real environment measured the same way. The bare C++ core runs an idle episode in 111 microseconds, against 202 for the upstream port it is built on.

## How to use it well

**Rule one: validate before you trust.** Run the golden test after every install and after every engine update, and wire your tools with a FALLBACK to the real environment so a divergence degrades to slow instead of to wrong:

```python
def make_bank_fn():
    """Prefer kagsim; fall back to kaggle_environments if it is absent
    or fails its self-check. Same signature either way."""
    try:
        import kagsim
        # self-check: one known episode must reproduce exactly
        s = kagsim.Stream([])                    # idle vs idle
        b0, b1 = kagsim.run_episode(s, s, seed=11)
        assert (b0, b1) == (3000.0, 3000.0), "kagsim self-check failed"

        def bank(stream_a, stream_b, seed):
            return kagsim.run_episode(stream_a, stream_b, seed)
        bank.backend = "kagsim"
        return bank
    except Exception:
        from kaggle_environments import make

        def bank(actions_a, actions_b, seed):
            env = make("kaggriculture",
                       configuration={"episodeSteps": 720,
                                      "seed": int(seed)})
            env.reset(2)
            t = 0
            while not env.done:
                a = actions_a[t] if t < len(actions_a) else None
                b = actions_b[t] if t < len(actions_b) else None
                env.step([a or {"farmer": ["PASS"], "hands": [],
                                "market": []},
                          b or {"farmer": ["PASS"], "hands": [],
                                "market": []}])
                t += 1
            return (float(env.state[0].reward or 0),
                    float(env.state[1].reward or 0))
        bank.backend = "kaggle_environments"
        return bank
```

Stronger than the smoke self-check: keep one of the bundled traces next to your pipeline and assert `tests/test_golden.py` passes in CI or at tool start-up. It costs half a second.

**Where kagsim applies, and where it does not:**

* USE IT for anything fixed-vs-fixed: replayed opponents, recorded streams, search populations, arena round-robins, big seed panels.
* For opponents that are live Python callables, use the L1 step-mode `Game`: it hands your agent the same observation dict the real interpreter builds, turn by turn. Validated two ways (tests/test_l1.py): a lockstep observation diff against the real environment (6/6 bundled traces exact, ~10k field-blocks each), and a heavyweight public adaptive agent reproducing its real-environment final banks to the dollar with a ~15x wall-clock speedup (the remaining cost is the agent's own Python, not the engine).

```python
game = kagsim.Game(seed)                      # steps=720 by default
while not game.done:
    a = my_stream[game.step_count]            # a fixed side, or another agent
    b = my_agent(game.observe(1))             # your agent, unmodified
    game.step(a, b)
print(game.reward(0), game.reward(1))
```
* Re-derive any number you plan to PUBLISH on the real environment at least once. Bit-exact is bit-exact, but the claim should not depend on my build chain.

## What this is for

* **Fixed-vs-fixed evaluation at scale**: seed panels of thousands instead of three, which is what kills panel overfitting (a search that spends generations on a 3-seed screen learns the seeds).
* **Search inner loops**: genetic/annealing searches whose candidates are action streams need no Python callback at all.
* **RL**: a step-level API is the natural next layer over `Sim::step` (see the architecture note below).

## Verifying it yourself

Never trust a simulator you have not validated:

```bash
# C++ core against the bundled 1.32.7 traces
g++ -O3 -std=c++17 -o validate tools/validate.cpp && ./validate traces/*.txt

# Python bindings against the same traces
python tests/test_golden.py

# export fresh traces from YOUR environment and check those instead
python tools/export_trace.py --agents your_agent.py,other.py 11 23 47

# memory soak: RSS trend over 60k episodes + 20k Stream constructions (exit 1 on a leak signature)
python tests/soak_memory.py
```

The trace format records the actions both agents actually produced plus money and market inventory at every step; `validate` replays the actions and demands equality. If you find a divergence, assume this port is wrong and please open an issue with the trace.

See ROADMAP.md for where the layers stand and why L2 deliberately waits for its first consumer.

## Settle telemetry: what the engine does in silence, counted

This engine refuses in silence by design: an underfunded purchase simply
does not happen, a SELL fills only what the settle-time shed holds, the
shed cap destroys overflow production without a message. From outside, a
stream that emits those orders looks identical to one that executes them,
and that gap has produced real measurement errors (an outside-in audit
once explained a 24-vs-16 disagreement with a subtle biology story when
the truth was a stale build; with both instruments correct they agree to
the unit).

`Game.telemetry(player)` returns per-farm counters gathered at the exact
settle sites:

    {"sell_dead_units": ..,        # SELL units refused: shed empty, full
                                   # remaining counted at order death
     "refused_buy_product": ..,    # BUY_PRODUCT units refused (funds/cap)
     "refused_buy_seed": ..,       # BUY_SEED units refused (funds)
     "refused_buy_animal": ..,     # BUY_ANIMAL units refused (funds/cap)
     "refused_hire": ..,           # HIREs refused (funds or unit cap)
     "refused_buy_land": ..,       # BUY_LANDs refused (funds/none left)
     "hire_paid": ..,              # coins actually paid for hires
     "sell_revenue": ..,           # coins actually received from SELLs
     "total_spend": ..,            # coins actually paid out
     "shed_discarded_units": ..,   # production the 100-cap destroyed
     "sold_units": ..}

The counters are instrumentation only: they observe and never alter, so
behaviour and parity are unaffected (the golden tests and the bank-exact
parity fixtures pass unchanged). `tests/test_telemetry.py` pins the
contract with known-truth scenarios: an underfunded 9-cow order counts
exactly its 2 undeliverable units, an empty-shed SELL of 6 counts 6 dead
units, a clean game counts zero everywhere.

What it is for, in practice:

* **Error detection**: a search or a hand-edited schedule that silently
  defunds its own farm shows up as nonzero refused counters instead of a
  mysteriously weak bank. The first consumer, a schedule GA one repo over,
  had its best genome exposed as refusing 24 of its own 104 animal buys.
* **Fitness shaping**: a compliance penalty per refused structural
  purchase inside a GA's objective costs one counter read per game and
  removes an entire class of degenerate optima (win by self-demolition).
* **Optimization niches**: dead sell volume localizes mis-timed sells,
  `shed_discarded_units` localizes harvest/sell scheduling waste,
  `hire_paid` against plan expectations localizes financing gaps. Each
  nonzero counter is a place to look with a magnitude attached.

One build ritual note: `sim.hpp` is a header, so after editing it run
`touch python/kagsim.cpp` before `build_ext --inplace`, or the extension
rebuild is silently skipped and you will be reading a stale binary.

## Architecture

```
sim/        sim.hpp, pyrandom.hpp: the engine core (header-only)
tools/      validate.cpp, bench.cpp, export_trace.py: the fidelity harness
traces/     the bundled 1.32.7 validation battery
python/     kagsim.cpp: pybind11 bindings (L0 batch API)
tests/      golden test through the bindings
```

Layers, by design:

* **L0**: pre-converted `Stream`s, `run_episode` / `run_many`, GIL released. For fixed-vs-fixed workloads at ~2,000 eps/sec/core.
* **L1 (since 0.2.0)**: step-mode `Game` with `observe(player)` emitting the real interpreter's observation dicts exactly (tests/test_l1.py is the proof: lockstep-identical against the real environment on every bundled trace, and a public adaptive agent banks identical money inside it). Crossing the C++/Python boundary each turn costs real time, so wall-clock is set by your agent, not the engine: a no-op agent runs hundreds of episodes per second, a heavy one ~15x faster than on the real environment.
* **L2 (planned)**: many episodes advancing in lockstep with tensor observations, for RL at scale.
* **L2 (planned)**: vectorized batched envs for serious RL.

## Version discipline

`kagsim.ENGINE_VERSION` says which engine this build reproduces (currently `1.32.7`). A measurement carries the engine it was taken on: when the competition rebalances, the traces regenerate first, the sim gets patched second, and nothing is trusted until `validate` passes again.

Apache 2.0, preserving the upstream license. Maintained by [destbreso](https://www.kaggle.com/destbreso); engine core by [nikital7](https://www.kaggle.com/nikital7).

## Local patch (2026-09-11, this repository)

`python/kagsim.cpp`: an invalid or empty market order (`[]`) now keeps its queue slot instead of being
dropped. The real engine parses `[]` to `None` but still advances the index, so later orders pair with the
opponent's orders at the same index. Without this, 4 of 5 recorded ladder games diverged by tens of coins;
with it, 12/12 recorded games reproduce bit-exactly and step-mode margins match the real environment.
